# TDual
Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning requires the concurrent modeling of structural dependencies and temporal dynamics to predict future facts with high fidelity. Contemporary approaches employ homogeneous processing paradigms for heterogeneous graph components coupled with elementary temporal encoding schemes, substantially constraining their capacity to capture the intrinsic semantic distinctions between entities and relations. We present TDual, a novel dual-stream architecture that addresses these fundamental limitations through principled architectural design. Our framework introduces parallel processing pathways that independently encode entity-centric topological structure and relation-centric interaction dynamics, unified through learnable adaptive fusion, thereby better preserving their distinct semantic characteristics. We further propose a sophisticated temporal gating mechanism leveraging parameterized Fourier bases with learnable frequency and phase components, enabling the capture of complex periodic phenomena and temporal transitions within a unified computational framework. Our design philosophy stems from the observation that entities constitute persistent objects with gradually evolving attributes, while relations encode transient interactions exhibiting distinct temporal signatures. Extensive empirical evaluation across four benchmark datasets establishes that TDual achieves state-of-the-art performance, with consistent improvements across all metrics. Notably, our analysis reveals that the proposed approach achieves its most substantial performance gains in complex multi-hop inference scenarios. These findings empirically validate that architectural decomposition of temporal knowledge graph reasoning into specialized computational pathways yields superior predictive performance.
